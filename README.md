# Data Preprocessing for Computer Vision Models Using Kaggle Datasets in Google Colab

This notebook demonstrates essential data preprocessing techniques for computer vision projects. It covers:

- **Image Resizing:** Standardizing image dimensions for model input.
- **Image Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to improve training stability.
- **Data Augmentation:** Enhancing dataset variability with transformations.
- **Grayscale/RGB Conversion:** Preparing images in the required color format.
- **Label Encoding:** Converting labels into a model-friendly format.

Utilizes Kaggle datasets via the Kaggle API in Google Colab for practical, hands-on examples. Perfect for practitioners, researchers, and enthusiasts in computer vision and deep learning.
